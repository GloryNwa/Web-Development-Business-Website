Hobbies and Interests
After my work day ends each day, I work on hobbies that are based on computers and technology. I am a volunteer at a local community technology venture that aims to bring high-tech devices to low-income neighborhoods. I work with local vendors to get technology donations onto a portable technology bus that visits various parts of the city several times a week. On the bus, I assist young people and the elderly with getting connected.
