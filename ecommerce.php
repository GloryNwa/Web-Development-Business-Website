               <br><br>
               <h5><strong></strong> <span class="colored">Appealing Website Design</span></h5>          
                <p>
                 The way your e-Commerce website looks is important. A shabbily-designed online store will turn customers away. At Brilliant Developers, we pride ourselves in our ability to design aesthetically appealing, pixel-perfect e-Commerce websites.

                <h5><strong></strong> <span class="colored">Website Security</span></h5>
             Due to sensitive customer information often collected by e-commerce websites, security is an important issue. While most online payment service providers already provide secure card payment systems, your ecommerce website still requires security. Brilliant Developers has implemented various security systems on websites, including:
                <p>
                  <li>Data Encryption</li>
                  <li> Data Backup</li>
                  <li> Server Security</li>
                  <li>Daily Vulnerability Scans</li>
                   <!-- <li>Establish your company in local search</li>
                  <li>Establish your brand/business on social media</li>
                  <li>Online reputation management</li> -->
               </ul>
               <br>

            

                <h5><strong></strong> <span class="colored">User-friendly Navigation & Layout</span></h5>
           
                <p>
                 For an online business to be successful, the website must be user-friendly. This is non-negotiable. At Brilliant Developers, we always design with User Experience (UX) in mind. The goal of eCommerce UX design is to give the website visitor a seamless, pleasurable shopping experience.
               </p>
               <br>

                <h5><strong></strong> <span class="colored">Mobile Friendly (Responsive)</span></h5>
           
                <p>
                 A truly responsive website is one that adapts seamlessly to the screen sizes and resolutions of the viewing device (PCs, Tablets, Phones or e-Readers). This makes a website mobile-friendly and convenient for website visitors.
               </p>
               <br>
                <h5><strong></strong> <span class="colored">Visitor Statistics (Analytics)</span></h5>
           
                <p>
               Brilliant Developers, we always integrate Google Analytics on websites we work on. This robust software gives our clients the ability to track and analyze detailed information about their website visitors. Through our integration of Google Analytics on an online store, our clients gain access to an enormous amount of information concerning the websiteâ€™s visitors.

            <br><br><br>
             <h5><strong></strong><span class="colored">  Multiple Payment Options</span></h5>
               Depending on business model, e-Commerce websites should have multiple payment options, making it easy for customers to complete their orders. Brilliant Developers has integrated different payment methods on websites including:
                <ul>
                  <li> Pay in Store</li>
                  <li>Pay on Delivery</li>
                  <li> Bank Transfer/Deposit</li>
                  <li>Online Payment (Interswitch, Paypal, Paystack, Quickteller)</li>
                   <!-- <li>Establish your company in local search</li>
                  <li>Establish your brand/business on social media</li>
                  <li>Online reputation management</li> -->
               </ul>

                <br><br><br>
                <h5><strong></strong> <span class="colored">Effortless Management & Updates</span></h5>
           
                <p>
                 The online stores we build come with a user-friendly content management system (CMS) which gives website and business administrators the ability to update the online store effortlessly. From updating product information to changing website graphics, the CMS makes it easy to keep the website up-to-date.
